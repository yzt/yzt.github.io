	<h2>Me</h2>
	<p>My name is Yaser Zhian, a programmer, and this is my new corner of the web (hopefully.) However, no content is available here at this time, except for <a href="yzt_email_comm_pub.asc">my public key (0x4A237149)</a>.</p>
	
	<h2>Project Blacknot</h2>
	<p>In March of 2015, inspired by a project called "Handmade Hero", I started an attempt to write a non-trivial 2D game on camera, from scratch, and explain everything. I'm doing this first and foremost to learn something myself, but also in the hope that these videos <em>might</em> be useful to others. <strong>Note that this series is in Farsi.</strong></p>
	<ul>
		<li>The main source of the videos is YouTube (for now) and every video gets added to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3R9mYgM4NVw4m0PTXBzQZBV2DzCt92Sp">this playlist</a>.</li>
		<li>There is also a semblance of a community in <u>this Facebook group</u> (link to be added.)</li>
		<li>You can send me any questions, suggestions, etc. <em>regarding Project Blacknot</em> to <a href="mailto:blacknotREMOVE@THISgmx.com">blacknotREMOVE@THISgmx.com</a>.</li>
		<li>The source code (and probably other assets of the game) are available in <a href="https://github.com/yzt/blacknot">this GitHub repo</a>.</li>
